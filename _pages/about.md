I am currently working as a research intern at the Joint Program of Science and Policy of Global Change at the Massuchussets Institute of Technology on using Deep Learning methods for high impact weather events. I received my B.E (Hons) degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a Minor in Data Science from the Birla Institute of Techonology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani). As part of my undergraduate thesis I worked in Dr. Michael Young's research group at the University of Texas at Austin on investigating spaceborne GNSS-R data from NASA's CYGNSS mission for high spatio-temporal soil moisture retrievals using Machine Learning.
