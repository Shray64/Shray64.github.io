I recently received my B.E (Hons) degree in Computer Science and Engineering with a Minor in Data Science from the Birla Institute of Techonology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani). I am currently working as a research intern at the Massachussets Institute of Technology at the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change where I am investigating the use of Upsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning approaches to predict extreme precipitation events and idenitfy accompanying synoptic scale atmospheric forcing patterns. With previous research experience in the fields of Computer Vision and Explainable AI, I am very interested in exploring their applications in interdisciplinary research areas including Climate Science, Agriculture, Remote Sensing Physics-Guided Machine Learning and and bio-medical image analysis. 



<!-- Synoptic scale forcings
Spaceborne GNSS-R
Agriculture and Remote Sensing
Statistical Forescasting and Machine Learning
Computer Vision
Biomedical Image Segmentation 
Explainable AI
Extreme Weather events

My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, multi-task and meta-learning and multi-agent systems -->
