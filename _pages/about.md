I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Harvard University, advised by Prof. [Hanspeter Pfister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanspeter_Pfister). I am interested in computer vision, deep learning, and neuroscience. My current projects include semantic & instance segmentation, active learning, unsupervised learning, and the analysis of comprehensive neuron connectivity in microscopy images of animal brains (connectomics).
