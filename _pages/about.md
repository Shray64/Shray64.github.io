I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science in the School of Engineering and Applied Science at Harvard University. I received B.S. in Biological Science from Tsinghua University in 2017 and M.S. in Computer Science from Harvard University in 2020. I  am  interested  in  computer  vision,  deep  learning,  and  neuroscience.   My  current  projects  includesemantic & instance segmentation, active learning, unsupervised learning, and the analysis of compre-hensive neuron connectivity in microscopy images of animal brains (connectomics).
